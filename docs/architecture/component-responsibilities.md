# Component Responsibilities & Industrial Practices

## Why This Architecture?

As a junior developer, you might wonder: "Why so complex? Can't I just call OpenAI API directly in a route?"

**Short answer**: NO. That's amateur hour.

**Long answer**: This architecture follows these industrial principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has ONE job
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
3. **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
4. **Testability**: Every component can be tested in isolation
5. **Scalability**: Can handle growth without rewriting

## Component Deep Dive

### 1. API Layer (`app/api/`)

**Responsibility**: HTTP contract management ONLY

```
BAD (What juniors do):
- Business logic in routes
- Direct database queries
- API key validation in routes

GOOD (Industrial standard):
- Routes only handle HTTP concerns
- Delegates to services
- Uses dependency injection
```

**Example workflow**:
1. Receives HTTP request
2. Validates request schema
3. Calls appropriate service
4. Transforms service response to HTTP response
5. Handles HTTP errors

### 2. Domain Models (`app/models/domain/`)

**Responsibility**: Business rules and invariants

These are your "pure" business objects that know nothing about databases or APIs.

```python
# Example: Question domain model
class Question:
    def __init__(self, content, subject, difficulty):
        self._validate_difficulty(difficulty)
        self._validate_content(content)
        # Business rules live here
    
    def calculate_similarity(self, other_question):
        # Domain logic, not database logic
```

### 3. Services Layer (`app/services/`)

**Responsibility**: Business workflow orchestration

This is where your actual business logic lives. Services:
- Coordinate between multiple components
- Implement business workflows
- Handle transactions
- DON'T know about HTTP

**Question Generation Workflow**:
```
QuestionService.generate_similar_question()
    ├── Validate input question
    ├── Call AI service
    │   ├── Build prompt (PromptManager)
    │   ├── Call OpenAI (OpenAIClient)
    │   └── Parse response
    ├── Verify generated question
    │   ├── Check similarity score
    │   ├── Validate format
    │   └── Run quality checks
    └── Return or retry
```

### 4. Infrastructure Layer (`app/infrastructure/`)

**Responsibility**: External system integration

- Database connections
- Cache management
- Message queues
- Third-party APIs

**Why separate?**: Tomorrow you might switch from PostgreSQL to MongoDB, or Redis to Memcached. Your business logic shouldn't care.

### 5. Error Handling Strategy

```
API Layer: HTTP errors (400, 404, 500)
    ↓
Service Layer: Business exceptions (QuestionGenerationFailed)
    ↓
Infrastructure: Technical exceptions (DatabaseConnectionError)
```

### 6. Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests** (80% of tests):
- Test services with mocked dependencies
- Test domain models
- Fast, isolated

**Integration Tests** (15% of tests):
- Test API endpoints with real database
- Test external integrations
- Slower but more realistic

**E2E Tests** (5% of tests):
- Test complete workflows
- Catch integration issues

### 7. Configuration Management

**Environment-based**:
```
development: Local development settings
testing: CI/CD pipeline settings
staging: Pre-production
production: Live environment
```

**Secret Management**:
- Never commit secrets
- Use environment variables
- Rotate API keys regularly

## Common Junior Mistakes to Avoid

1. **"Works on my machine"**
   - Solution: Docker containers
   
2. **"I'll add tests later"**
   - Solution: TDD or at least test alongside development
   
3. **"This function does everything"**
   - Solution: Single Responsibility Principle
   
4. **"I'll just catch all exceptions"**
   - Solution: Specific exception handling
   
5. **"Direct database queries in routes"**
   - Solution: Repository pattern

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache generated questions for similar inputs
   - Cache OpenAI responses (if allowed by ToS)
   - Invalidate cache intelligently

2. **Async Processing**:
   - Question generation can be slow
   - Use background tasks for verification
   - Return job IDs for long operations

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - OpenAI has rate limits
   - Implement backoff strategies
   - Queue requests during high load

## Security Considerations

1. **API Security**:
   - API key authentication
   - Rate limiting per client
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention

2. **Data Security**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Log sanitization
   - GDPR compliance for student data

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **Structured Logging**:
   - Correlation IDs for request tracking
   - Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Centralized log aggregation

2. **Metrics**:
   - Question generation success rate
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - OpenAI API usage

3. **Alerts**:
   - High error rates
   - Slow response times
   - Low success rates

## Future Extensibility

Your architecture should handle:
1. Multiple AI providers (not just OpenAI)
2. Different question types
3. Batch processing
4. Real-time features
5. Multi-tenancy

Remember: Good architecture is not about predicting the future, but about making change easy when the future arrives.
